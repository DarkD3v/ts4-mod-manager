**TS4 Mod Manager** is a straightforward tool designed to simplify the management of mods for The Sims 4. With this utility, you can easily enable or disable mods by moving their folders in and out of the game's Mods directory. The manager also allows you to archive disabled mods in a separate folder within the program's directory, keeping your Mods folder organized and clutter-free.

# Key features
 - **Mod Activation/Deactivation**: Easily manage which mods are active by moving them between folders.
 - **Archiving**: Disabled mods are stored in an archive within the program, keeping your game directory clean.
 - **Simple Interface**: Just add the mod folder or file name to manage your mods effortlessly.
